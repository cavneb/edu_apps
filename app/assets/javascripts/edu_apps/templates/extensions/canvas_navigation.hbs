  <h2 class="page-header">Canvas Navigation Examples</h2>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    In Canvas you can configure an LTI tool to have a link in the navigation for a course, account, or user.See Canvas documentation for more details <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/navigation_tools.html#account_navigation">more information</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The examples are very basic, really just enough to get the point of the extension across. If you are interested in seeing more advanced or practical implementations, check out <a href="/index.html">the list of LTI apps on the home page</a>.

      <h3>Course Navigation Demo</h3>
      <p>
          This is an example of a standard configuration for adding a link to
          course navigation. This link is available to anyone with access to
          the course. If it's configured at the account level, the link will
          be added to all courses within that account. Permissions can be set
          to determine which user types have access to the app, and whether
          the app is enabled by default for all applicable courses, or if
          it needs to be configured manually for each course.

      <h3>Account Navigation Demo</h3>
      <p>
          This is an example of a standard configuration for adding a link to
          account navigation. This link is available to anyone with access to
          the account. The link will appear in the current account and any
          sub-accounts of that account. Remember that app launches will send
          all role types associated with a user, which in the case of
          account-level links should always include at least the admin role,
          <code>urn:lti:instrole:ims/lis/Administrator</code>.

      <h3>User Navigation Demo</h3>
        <p>
            This is an example of a standard configuration for adding a link
            to
            user navigation. This link is available to anyone with access to
            the institution, and will appear as a navigation item whey they
            click their profile or user information link.
